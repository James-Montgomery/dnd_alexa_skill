# D&D Alexa Skill

A fun side project to practice developing Alexa Skills by creating an app that provides basic D&D utilities. What is D&D? Dungeons and Dragons is a popular role playing game. It's really fun if you can find the right group, but it has many rules and can be a bit tedious at times.

This app supports a few fun utilities to help any (5th Edition) D&D session go a little bit smoother:
* "Rolling" Dice
* Spell Trivia
* ...more coming soon

## A) Set Up

Before launching the web application, make sure that you have all dependancies installed and properly set up. A complete guide to dependency set up is provided in the [prerequisites file](./prerequisites.md).

## B)

* Set Up Skill in Alexa Hub
* Set Up Code for Skill
* Deploy Lambda using Terraform
* Populate DynamoDB Table

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to [open5e](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e). Getting much of this data would have been extremely tedious if not for the efforts of eepMoody in creating open5e. Another big thank you to the publishers of D&D: [Wizards of the Coast](http://company.wizards.com/).

A personal thank you to Jon Rider and Kate Highnam who introduced me to D&D!
