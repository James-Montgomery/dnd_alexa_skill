## Connecting Your Voice User Interface To Your Lambda Function

On [page #1](./1-voice-user-interface.md) of this guide, we created a voice user interface for the intents and utterances we expect from our users.  On [page #2](./2-lambda-function.md), we created a Lambda function that contains all of our logic for the skill.  On this page, we need to connect those two pieces together.

1.  **Go back to the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and select your skill from the list.** You may still have a browser tab open if you started at the beginning of this tutorial.

2. Select the **Endpoint** tab on the left side navigation panel.

3.  **Select the "AWS Lambda ARN" option for your endpoint.** You have the ability to host your code anywhere that you would like, but for the purposes of simplicity and frugality, we are using AWS Lambda. ([Read more about Hosting Your Own Custom Skill Web Service](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-web-service).)  With the AWS Free Tier, you get 1,000,000 free requests per month, up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Learn more at https://aws.amazon.com/free/.  In addition, Amazon now offers [AWS Promotional Credits for developers who have live Alexa skills that incur costs on AWS related to those skills](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-aws-credits).

4.  Paste your Lambda's ARN (Amazon Resource Name) into the textbox provided for **Default Region**.

5. Click the **Save Endpoints** button at the top of the main panel.
