312, 1 action, v,"wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. by simplyspeaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accordwith your desires.the basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th levelor lower. you don't need to meet any requirements in that spell,including costly components. the spell simply takes effect.alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of yourchoice  you create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic   item. the object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and   it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.  you allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit   points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater   restoration spell.  you grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage   type you choose.  you grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell   or other magical effect for 8 hours. for instance, you could make   yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain   attack.  you undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made   within the last round (including your last turn). reality reshapes   itself to accommodate the new result. for example, a wish spell could   undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a   friend's failed save. you can force the reroll to be made with   advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the   reroll or the original roll.  you might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above   examples. state your wish to the gm as precisely as possible. the gm   has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the   greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes   wrong. this spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only   be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence   as a result of how you worded the wish. for example, wishing that a   villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when   that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the   game. similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might   instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.the stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other thanduplicating another spell weakens you. after enduring that stress, eachtime you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10necrotic damage per level of that spell. this damage can't be reduced orprevented in any way. in addition, your strength drops to 3, if it isn't3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. for each of those days that you spendresting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remainingrecovery time decreases by 2 days. finally, there is a 33 percent chancethat you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.", instantaneous,9thlevel conjuration, self,wish
